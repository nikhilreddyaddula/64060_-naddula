#As per graph:- 

#Cluster 1 :In this cluster, which also includes distinct Hold, Moderate Buy, Moderate Sell, and Strong Buy medians, the Hold median is the highest. They are from the US, the UK, and Switzerland and are traded on the NYSE.

#Cluster 2:AMEX, NASDAQ, and NYSE all have an equal distribution of companies, but there is a clear Hold and Moderate Buy median as well as a different count between the US and Germany.

#Cluster 3: listed on the NYSE, has distinct counts for France, Ireland, and the US, and has medians for buy and sell orders that are equally moderate.

#Cluster 4: has the same hold and moderate buy medians and is spread out across the US, UK, and listed in.

#Cluster 5: #exclusively listed on the NYSE, evenly distributed across the US and Canada, with medians of Hold and Moderate Buy.

#With respect to media Recommendation Variable ,the clusters follow a particular pattern:
#Cluster 1 and Cluster 2 has Hold Recommendation.
#Cluster 3, Cluster 4and Cluster 5 has moderate buy Recommendation.



```{r}
# (d) Give each cluster a suitable name using any or all of the dataset's variables.

#Cluster 1 :-  HIGH HOLD CLUSTER
#Cluster 2 :- HOLD CLUSTER
#Cluster 3 :- BUY-SELL CLUSTER
#Cluster 4 :- HOLD-BUY CLUSTER
#Cluster 5 :- HOLD-BUY CLUSTER
